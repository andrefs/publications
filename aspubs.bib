  abstract = {{Languages are born, evolve and, eventually, die. During this evolution
	their spelling rules (and sometimes the syntactic and semantic ones)
	change, putting old documents out of use. In Portugal, a pair of
	political agreements with Brazil forced relevant changes on the way
	the Portuguese language is written. In this article we will detail
	these two Orthographic Agreements (one in the thirties and the other
	more recently, in the nineties), and the challenges present on the
	automatic migration of old documents spelling to their actual one.
	We will reveal Bigorna, a toolkit for the classification of language
	variants, their comparison and the conversion of texts in different
	language versions. These tools will be explained together with examples
	of migration issues. As Birgorna relies on a set of conversion rules
	we will also discuss how to infer conversion rules from a set of
	documents (texts with different ages). The document concludes with
	a brief evaluation on the conversion and classification tool results
	and their relevance in the current Portuguese language scenario.}},

  title = {{AGile, a structured editor, analyzer, metric evaluator, and transformer
	for Attribute Grammars}},
  booktitle = {INForum 2010, Braga, Portugal},
  year = {2010},
  abstract = {{As edit, analyze, measure or transform attribute grammars by hand
	is an exhaustive task, it would be great if it could be automatized,
	specially for those who work in Language Engineering. However, currently
	there are no editors oriented to grammar development that cover all
	our needs. In this paper we describe the architecture and the development
	stages of AG- ile, a structured editor, analyzer, metric calculator
	and transformer for attribute grammars. It is intended, with this
	tool, to fill the existing gap. An AnTLR based attribute grammar
	syntax was used to define the input for this system. As soon as the
	user types the grammar, the input is parsed and kept in an intermediate
	structure in memory which holds the important information about the
	input grammar. This intermediate structure can be used to calculate
	all the metrics or to transform the input grammar. This system can
	be a valorous tool for those who need to improve the perfor- mance
	or functionalities of their language processor, speeding up the difficult
	task of defining and managing a language. Features like highlighting,
	automatic indentation, on-the-fly error detection, etc., also adds
	efficiency.}},
